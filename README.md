**Note:** This extension is no longer available on the Chrome Web Store, as this was a time-limited experiment to validate my PhD research. If you are interested, check out the results in my [PhD thesis](http://bit.ly/simonphd) (Chapter 7) or the [MovieBrain paper](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1247/recsys14_poster19.pdf) (presented as a poster at the RecSys 2014 conference, October 6-10, 2014, Foster City, Silicon Valley, USA.

MovieBrain, is a chrome extension that integrates your IMDb ratings to provide more customizable movie recommendations. If you have an IMDb account, your ratings will be imported and provided to the 'brain', which is the all-knowing recommender system powering this extension. You can get movie recommendations and more interestingly, you can fine-tune specific settings of the recommendation process to improve the quality of your movie recommendation list. This is a proof of concept of the PhD research by [Simon Dooms](http://twitter.com/sidooms) (Ghent University, Belgium).
